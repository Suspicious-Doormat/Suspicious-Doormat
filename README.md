Hi, maybe I'm being suspicious. I like boring things, such as Rust, Python or (sometimes) C/C++. Also, things
that you'd expect to work everyday, including operating systems, the network stack or whatever; I'm a simple
man. I'm happy with it. I see the simple things and think to myself if it could have better functionality, then
i wake up and realise that if that happens, it's not going to be simple anymore; tragic. This is life, boringly
refreshing, simple yet it is all you are going to ever need.
